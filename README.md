# Blind-Auction-Program
This Python app simulates a silent auction where participants can place bids on an item. The program collects the names and bid amounts from each participant and determines the highest bidder at the end of the auction.
# Features:
* Bid Collection: Collects the names and bid amounts from participants.

* Highest Bidder Determination: Identifies the participant with the highest bid.

* Interactive Interface: Allows participants to continue bidding until there are no more bidders.

* Clear Screen: Clears the screen between rounds to maintain privacy for new bidders.

# How to Use:
1- Run the script.

2- The program will display a logo and prompt the first bidder to enter their name and bid amount.

3- After each bid, the program will ask if there are any other bidders.

4- If there are more bidders, the screen will clear, and the next bidder can enter their details.

5- Once all bidders have placed their bids, the program will determine and announce the winner with the highest bid.
